MENU

  Use the mouse to navigate the menus. Player will start on test floor when New Game or Continue is selected. The option menu is for show.
New Game will restart the gold counter and Continue will save the amount. There are no in-game menus, so no inventory.

MOVEMENT

  The player will move one unit per key input. Standard WASD movement. If left shift is held down with the movement button the player will 
continue to in the corresponding direction. If the space bar is held the player will turn in the corresponding direction with moving any
units. 
  The return key is the attack button. The player must be next to a monster for it to work. There are no indicators for when the monster 
is hit, but their object is destroyed when their HP reaches 0.

W = up
A = left
S = down
D = right
